# EyeStatusRecognition-DeepLearning

**Eye Status Detection using DeepLearning**

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution to detect the status of eyes, distinguishing between open and closed states. Using the powerful InceptionV3 pre-trained model from Keras and employing transfer learning, i aim to achieve high accuracy with minimal data requirements.
